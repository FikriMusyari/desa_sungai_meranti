# Code Study Report

## Overview
The codebase is a Laravel application designed for village administration, focusing on document management, user authentication, and document issuance workflows.

## Architecture
- **MVC Architecture**: Clear separation of models, controllers, and views
- **API Integration**: RESTful API endpoints for both web and mobile clients
- **Database Design**: Well-structured relationships between entities
- **Security**: Role-based access control and Sanctum API authentication
- **Services**: Dedicated service class for document generation

## Key Components
### Models
- UserDesa: Custom user model with custom primary key (NIK) and authentication integration
- PengajuanSurat: Document request model with approval workflow
- JenisSurat: Document type management
- SuratTerbit: Document issuance tracking

### Controllers
- AuthController: Handles user registration, login, and logout
- AdminPengajuanController: Manages document approval and generation
- PengajuanController: Handles document request creation and management

### Routes
- Web routes: Frontend navigation and basic pages
- API routes: Authentication and document management endpoints
